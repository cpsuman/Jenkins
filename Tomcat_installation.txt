Installation of Tomcat on RHEL:
â€¢	Download Tomcat from official website: https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi  (tar.gz pgp, sha512)

o	sudo tar -xvf apache-tomcat-8.5.33
o	move the extracted file to /opt/
o	assign the current user to the tomcat directory from the root or can create    a new user and group in the name of tomcat  
o	after assigning the user to the tomcat server go to the bin folder and start the tomcat using ./startu.sh command.
o	Before accessing the tomcat url we need to goto the /conf folder i.e. tomcat user.xml and assign the role and the username for administration. 
o	After configuration we can access the url by using ip_address:8080/ , after hiting the url its prompt for the username and password. So, we have to give the same username and password, which we have defined in the conf file.
